               <p>Close your eyes. Think about your favourite city or place to visit. Now, imagine a food you love passionately. I’m sure you smiled! 
                That’s it, eating and travelling are things that really move us. Well, that is what Food Travel means. 
                Is there a better thing than to combine these two passions in a culinary trip?</p><br>
                <img class="foodpic"src="imagesreal/food4.webp">
                <h3>What is Food Travel</h3><br>
                <p>Food Travel means moving around with the aim of<strong> exploring a destination gastronomic offer. </strong>
                  Exploring the pleasures of the table has always been associated with moments of leisure, but on a gastronomic trip, the culinary experience is no longer just a 
                  complement but the<strong> main motivation in choosing a destination and in the way of exploring it.</strong></p><br>
                <img class="foodpic" src="imagesreal/food3.webp">
                <h3>Food and Travel, an experience we never forget</h3><br>
                <p>What we want to highlight is that, in practice, when we combine travel with gastronomy, there is a whole set of experiences and learnings about the history, traditions, environment and local culture that go beyond taste. Realizing this is life-changing!<br><br>
                  On a trip, we want to have different experiences from our daily lives. These experiences become remarkable when you feel connected with them. That’s exactly how food plays its role.<br><br>
                  The bond with food is a universal language, after all, no matter where you came from, food is certainly part of your history. That is why every travel memory always comes with a flavour. </p><br>
                <img class="foodpic" src="imagesreal/food2.webp">
                <h3>The experience is for everyone</h3><br>
                <p>It is a mistake to think that this type of trip is only for those who like to (and can) eat in renowned restaurants, or visit expensive wineries. The food tourism industry is creative and aware of the interests of travellers.<br><br>
                  Best of all, it is a democratic and flexible way of travelling. Nowadays, you can easily explore a gastronomic culture in different ways: in the countryside or in the city, individually or in groups, with luxury, with adventure. There is a broad range of options for all budgets and tastes.  <br><br>
                  We should not fail to mention that technology has also helped a lot of people who are looking for food experiences during a trip. Today, you can easily find online restaurant reviews, menu translation, independent guides, local dining platforms, and more.  <br><br>               
                  For example, how about including a cooking class on your next trip? In addition to having fun while learning traditional dishes, you can cook these dishes when you return home, and remember the trip while sharing the experience with friends and family.</p>
